Release succesfully built!
To start the release you have built, you can use one of the following tasks:

    # start a shell, like 'iex -S mix'
    > _build/prod/rel/pressure_test/bin/pressure_test console

    # start in the foreground, like 'mix run --no-halt'
    > _build/prod/rel/pressure_test/bin/pressure_test foreground

    # start in the background, must be stopped with the 'stop' command
    > _build/prod/rel/pressure_test/bin/pressure_test start

If you started a release elsewhere, and wish to connect to it:

    # connects a local shell to the running node
    > _build/prod/rel/pressure_test/bin/pressure_test remote_console

    # connects directly to the running node's console
    > _build/prod/rel/pressure_test/bin/pressure_test attach
